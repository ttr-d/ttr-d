Those lines above are the templates provided by github. I'd like to leave them there for me to refer in this few minutes (or maybe to make this page more colorful).

Let me start formally (but not that formal). My current major is computer science and that's the reason why I'm here and you're here. 
Few experience of programming, but with a little bit of interest and the current trend(u know), that's it. Hopefully, the skills of programming and deep learning might be the road that leads the bright future. Hope I can find my way to survive in the trend of technology. 

About my future research interests, tbh, I should find it out through the next few years of study, yeah.

Just like most programmers in CN (weird), I'm intersted in ACG culture. So if u have anything to share, feel free to mail me, maybe we can enjoy a pleasant conversation. 
Of course, if u have anything else to share, welcome.
Here is my bilibili profile
https://space.bilibili.com/73798552
where I (probably) have the highest ACG concentration there. U can also text me there. 
Probably there will be no video output in the coming few years (but I do hope I have), so burr~, let's wait and see.

PS：There might be some grammatical errors in the lines above, but I don't want to spend much time checking them up. So if you have any problems, just leave it there OK? Maybe this 'README' will be revised one day(idk).

If you have read all the way to the bottom:
    print('good job then, but no substantial benefits, wish you a good day')
else:
    print('wish me a good day')
